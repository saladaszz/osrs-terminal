# oldschoolscan
The repository for oldschoolscan, a linux based app for OSRS statistics.

Setup: Simply download the file and put it wherever you want
Note: You'll have to make the file an executable using 'chmod a+x oldschoolscan'
Note 2: Also, to run it use ./oldschoolscan

App is pretty self explanatory, reach out to me at saladasz#2254 on discord with any issues.
